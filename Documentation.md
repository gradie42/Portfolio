# Documentation

The aim  of this program is to improve my English. I want and I need to sharply increase my vocabulary, to have more facility to read, write and speak.

## This program is composed of three parties: 
  - The script in Python
  - The file mots.txt that contains the list of words in French and English
  - The menu

## For the script, it was necessary to add some criteria to have the right funcctionality for the program, like : 
  - To have the right to add and delete a word from the list of words
  - Normalization to make sure that the program will be indifferent to accent
  - Each word has a complementary word; that means a word must have a translation in English or French
  - Each word has a number of points from 0 to 7. When the word has obtained the maximum number of points, the program will not ask you about this word
  - Ask you in an aleatory way; that means it doesn't follow the order of the list to ask you.
  - Sometimes, it can start to ask you the translation for the word in English or the contrary in French.


## In the menu you have five choices: 
  - 1 : Add a word
  - 2 : Ask yourself
  - 3 : Display the list of the words
  - 4 : Delete a word
  - 5 : Quit

## How the program will react after the selection of one number from the menu 

1 : For the first, the program will ask you to write a word in French or English, and then it will ask you to write the translation.

2 : Secondly, the program will ask you a word in English or French, and then it will ask you to write the translation for the word. 
If your response it's correct, the program will add 1 point to the word. If it is not correct, you will have the display of the sentence "Incorrect. The correct answer was: {correct_answer}"

3 : Thirstily, you will have the list of the words with their translation and the number of points. Each word will be associated with a number. This number will permit selecting a word on the list and deleting it.

4 : The program will display the list of the words, and you will need to select one number associated with the word that you want to delete.

5 : The program will close.
