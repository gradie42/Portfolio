The aim goal of this program is to improve my english. I want and I need to sharp increase my vocabulary, to have more facility to read, write and speak.

## this program is composed by threee parties : 
  - the script in python
  - the file mots.txt that contain the list of words in french and english
  - the menu

## For the script, it was necessary to add somes criteria to have the right fonctionnality for the program like : 
  - To have the right to add and delete a word to the list of the word
  - Normaliszation to make sure that the program will be indifferent face  to accent
  - Each word have a complementary word, that's mean a word must have a translation in english or french
  - Each word have a number of points 0 to 7, when the word have obtained the maximum of points the program will not ask you about this word
  - Ask you in aleatory way , that's mean it doesn't folLow the order of the list to ask you 
  - Sometimes, it can start to ask you the translation for the word in english or the contrary in french


## In the menu you have five choices : 
  - 1 : Add a word
  - 2 : ask yourself
  - 3 : display the list of the words
  - 4 : delete a word
  - 5 : quit

## How the program will react after the selection of one number from the menu

2 : Secondly, the program will ask you a word in english or french and and then it will ask you to write the translation for the word. 
If your respond it's correct, the program will add 1 point to the word. If it is not correct you will have the display of the sentance " Incorrect. The correct answer was : {correct_answer}"
